be used to advise health officials. New research by Victoria University of Wellington will look into New Zealanders' experiences of Covid-19. The study, Impacts of Covid-19 in Aotearoa Ngā Kawekawe o Mate Korona, has been funded by the Ministry of Health, at a cost of $1m. It aims to survey people aged 16 and over who have had Covid-19 or were a probable case before 1 December, 2021. Co-lead of the study Dr Mona Jeffreys said the research includes online surveys and interviews. She said researchers were interested in hearing about the support people received, the quality of health services, financial impacts, and any long Covid symptoms. \"We know that for some people who are lucky, all the care that they needed has worked and we also know that there are plenty of people for whom that's not the case,\" she said. \"What I would love to see is that we have a more equitable outcome for people who've got Covid in the future.\" The results would be used to make recommendations about supporting people who have Covid-19 to the Ministry of Health. The researchers plan to contact nearly 9000 people by letter and text over the next two weeks, but Jeffreys said some people who were eligible may not be contacted if the ministry did not have up-to-date information for them. Fellow co-lead Dr Lynne Russell asked anyone who is eligible to take part. \"We want as many people as possible to take part in the surveys so we can understand their experiences of Covid-19 and assess the effectiveness of the services they received,\" she said. Russell said the effects of Covid-19 on Māori, Pacific communities and whānau hauā (disabled communities) are a key focus of the research.

proposal. Wellington's response follows Fiji's announcement this week that it was hoping to establish a tourism bubble with Australia and New Zealand, to attract visitors. Fiji Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said tourists could be contained and prevented from mixing with locals. \"VIP lanes - starting on the airplane, then from Nadi Airport onto designated transport to their designated resort or hotel where they'll remain throughout their stay\", Mr Bainimarama said. Fiji was identifying geographically-isolated resorts best suited for the Bula Bubble, he said. New Zealand said it was exploring opportunities to expand the concept of a trans-Tasman Covid-19 \"travel safe zone\". Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said while her government was talking with Pacific nations, it was imperative New Zealanders avoided spreading or contracting Covid-19 within the region. \"Fiji are in a position where they have seen lower numbers than many others (but) they haven't been entirely Covid-free though,\" Ms Ardern said. \"We've set up our own criteria for what we'd expect in the event of opening up bubbles. It's fair to say that at the moment, of course the border remains the biggest vulnerability so it's the area where we will be the most cautious.\" New Zealand's opposition leader Todd Muller said that criteria should be shared with Pacific nations like Fiji. \"They have been without a Covid case for many, many weeks now,\" he said. \"They are, I'm sure, putting huge pressure on New Zealand and Australia to be innovative in the way holiday travel could be opened up to that market.\" Fiji has not had a Covid-19 case in more than 60 days and it has been more than 90 days since its first case was reported. The Fiji government said while the country was not yet Covid-free, it was \"Covid-contained\". \"Contained is the key word here because as the pandemic rages around the world and until we have a globally-available vaccine, no country can truly claim to be truly covid-free so long as it allows its citizens to return to their home country,\" Mr Bainimarama said. \"We can aim for the next best thing: absolute containment. So long as those entering Fiji pose no risk to the public at large we will remain Covid-contained.\" Mr Bainimarama said Bula Bubble travellers would have to present a certificate from a recognised medical institution certifying 14 days of quarantine in their home country, along with proof of a negative Covid-19 test result within 48 hours of their departure to Fiji. Alternatively, upon arrival in Fiji, travellers could complete \"14 days of quarantine, at their own cost, in a Fijian government-designated quarantine centre or a hotel of their choosing, after which they would have to undergo a Covid-19 test\". \"If either Australia or New Zealand becomes Covid-contained, the quarantine requirements for travelers from that country will be lifted, and movement can expand beyond these bubbles to everywhere else in Fiji.\"\n",

Māori function which will manage enquiries relating to Covid-19 by iwi, hapuu marae and whānau. Pouwhakarae will ensure targeted support is given to Māori communities across Auckland. General Manager of Māori Outcomes, Tania Winslade, said among the biggest concerns for Māori at the moment was how to manage tangihanga and look after kaumatua. [https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/covid-19 See all RNZ coverage of Covid-19 \"We're listening to Māori and being led by what they tell us,\" she said. \"At this stage they say they need support with fundamentals like fit-for-purpose communications; how to plan and deal with agencies in an appropriate way for them; tangihanga; how to support whānau, particularly kaumatua during this time. \"Iwi are also looking to provide leadership and we will support them, if they want us to.\" If you have symptoms of the coronavirus, call the NZ Covid-19 Healthline on 0800 358 5453 (+64 9 358 5453 for international SIMs) or call your GP - don't show up at a medical centre The new function will direct whānau to the appropriate agencies depending on their requests or concerns. Parks, Arts, Community and Events Committee Chair Councillor Alf Filipaina said it will give Māori in Auckland a place to have their voices heard. Pouwhakarae will ensure that Māori communities in Tāmaki Makaurau have a platform to voice their needs and that they receive appropriate support as we face the challenges of Covid-19 together.

Despite the lockdown, it has been another busy day in the ongoing fight against Covid-19. The number of Covid-19 cases continues to climb, with almost 600 cases now recorded. The government has also vowed to look at price gouging, with a special email - pricewatch@mbie.govt.nz - set up for the public to report any cases.

since its last new case of Covid-19, the Ministry of Health has confirmed. In a statement, the Ministry confirmed another significant cluster had also been closed, bringing the total number of significant clusters closed to 10 out of 16. A significant cluster is 10 or more cases connected through transmission who are not all part of the same household, and is considered closed when there are no new connected cases for 28 days after the last case is no longer isolated. The last day that New Zealand reported an active case of Covid-19 was on 22 May. The ministry said it had completed another 2950 tests, bringing total tests in New Zealand to 304,832. It said the NZ Covid Tracer app had seen another 4000 registrations, bringing the total to about 550,000, with the number of business QR codes rising to 46,700. Confirmed cases remained at 1154, with probable cases bringing the total up to 1504. There were no further deaths, leaving New Zealand's total deaths from the virus at 21. The Ministry of Health yesterday announced that an independent review of Covid-19 clusters in aged care facilities confirms that the infections were introduced to the facilities by staff or visitors. *See all RNZ coverage of Covid-19 On Monday, the Health Ministry declared that the final remaining active case in New Zealand had recovered.

Remember to explore the images, videos and related articles to find out more about these topics. Health and Wellness (Gale) (https://go-gale-com.ezproxy.kotui.ac.nz/ps/start.do?p=HWRC&u=per_k12) This EPIC (https://natlib.govt.nz/librarians/epic/epic-for-new-zealand-schools/epic-resources-for-schools)database has trustworthy answers to health and medical questions.

Tips: To get to the EPIC resources you will need a password from your school librarian first. Or you can chat with one of our AnyQuestions librarians between 1 and 6 pm Monday to Friday and they will help you online. Some EPIC databases may also be available through your public library. World Health Organisation (WHO) (https://www.who.int/) The World Health Organisation (WHO for short) is a specialised agency of the United Nations responsible for international public health. Choose the tab at the top of the page called Health Topics and select All topics to explore the diseases covered by this site. Look at Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) (https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1) to find advice on how to protect yourself. Check out the Q&A section. Select Ebola virus disease (https://www.who.int/health-topics/ebola#tab=tab_1) to read about outbreaks. Get an overview, understand the symptoms and treatments and find news articles and pictures. Choose fact sheets to get information in a handy layout. Pick Smallpox (https://www.who.int/csr/disease/smallpox/en/) to research a disease which has been eradicated. Read aboutVaccines (https://www.who.int/topics/vaccines/en/) to explore one of the most effective ways to prevent diseases. Other tabs allow you to discover the work WHO does by Countries or by what Emergencies are happening in the world. Tips: Some websites have .au, .nz, .uk or other codes in their url. This can tell you which country this website comes from. The code .int is used for international organisations. You can check the About us (https://www.who.int/about) link on the website for more information. New Zealand sites These websites have information about the history of epidemics and pandemics in New Zealand. Also included is a current website that offers advice and information on how everyone can stay safe during an outbreak of COVID-19. Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand (http://www.teara.govt.nz/en) Te Ara is an excellent starting point for all questions about New Zealand Aotearoa. If we scroll down to the bottom of the page we can see that the website belongs to the Ministry for Culture & Heritage, so the information is well-researched and reliable. Scroll down the page to the section on Social Connections. Select Health from the range of topics, then Epidemics (https://teara.govt.nz/en/epidemics). Check out the history of epidemics in New Zealand, including typhoid, influenza and polio. Remember to explore External links and sources to find other useful websites with information on this topic. One example is the history of The 1918 influenza pandemic (https://nzhistory.govt.nz/culture/influenza-pandemic-1918)in New Zealand.

Explore Immunisation (https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/preventative-health-wellness/immunisation?mega=Our%20work&title=Immunisation) to find out how this can protect people against harmful infections. Tips: We like sites like this because they’re reliable. You can tell because of their web address – they have either .govt or .ac, meaning they are from government or educational organisations. They’re also New Zealand sites, so relevant for us. DigitalNZ (https://digitalnz.org/) DigitalNZ is a search site that focuses on New Zealand history and brings together results from lots of different websites. It’s an easy way of searching online resources from New Zealand libraries, museums, universities and government sites all at once, and has lots of primary sources. Type the keywords 'epidemic' or 'pandemic' into the search box. Use the tabs at the top of the results to limit them to images, videos, newspapers, articles and research papers. Tips: Search words, or keywords, are the most important words in our question. Usually it’s better to leave out small words like ‘the’, ‘a’ and ‘of’ and just choose the main ones, eg epidemic. We can always change our keywords or add more if we need to. Unite against COVID-19 (https://covid19.govt.nz/) This website was put together in 2020 by the Ministry of Health in New Zealand to provide people with all the information they need on the COVID-19 pandemic, including updates, and who to contact if you are stressed or worried.

banking and finance companies are being asked pause disconnections, debt collections and waive penalty fees as people struggle to pay their bills during the Covid-19 lockdown. Making the pleas in an open letter, 15 social service organisations also called for a moratorium on debt collection and late payment fees imposed by central and local government. \"Covid-19 is causing immense disruption to our society and our economy. Hundreds of thousands of New Zealanders and their families now face having to survive on a reduced income,\" the letter said. \"These people are worried about whether they can pay their rent or their mortgage, while keeping their homes warm and keeping food on the table.\" If you have symptoms of the coronavirus, call the NZ Covid-19 Healthline on 0800 358 5453 (+64 9 358 5453 for international SIMs) or call your GP - don't show up at a medical centre Essential services companies such as energy, telecommunications and internet, banking, finance, insurance and rental housing, should take \"additional steps\" to support their community during the Covid-19 crisis, it said. No disconnections or service cessation. Companies should continue to offer their services without interruption. Waive penalty and late fees, including additional interest charges. No one should pay extra while they are struggling to pay bills on time. Pause debt collection. People should not be pursued by debt collectors during this time. While some providers had already taken some of those steps, the group wanted to see \"coordinated industry-wide commitments to do the right thing by people, their families and whānau.\" \"We are calling on all essential service providers to publicly commit to implementing these minimum relief measures. Businesses and governments should not hesitate to go further.\" Christians Against Poverty chief executive Aimee Mai said it was now more important than ever that essential services and money lenders had compassion for New Zealanders facing hardship.

Some are seeking loans just to buy food,\" she said. Citizens Advice Bureau chief executive Kerry Dalton said it was vital that providers of services people could not do without \"do their bit and be socially responsible.\" \"They need to ensure that those whose income has been hit hard by the COVID 19 crisis continue to receive their essential services without this increasing hardship through debt or penalties.\" The 15 signatory groups on the letter are: Age Concern, Child Poverty Action Group, Christian Budgeting New Zealand, Christians Against Poverty, Citizens Advice Bureau NZ, Community Law Centres of Aotearoa, Consumer NZ, FinCap, Good Shepherd NZ, Methodist Alliance, New Zealand Council of Christian Social Services, Nga Tangata Microfinance, NZ Council of Trade Unions, Social Services Providers Aotearoa and The Salvation Army.

and Pasifika people. New research from Auckland University of Technology's NZ Work Research Institute (NZWRI), showed the disparities were worse in particular for Pasifika women, those under 30 and people living in Auckland. For example, pre-Covid-19 - for young (under 30 years of age) unemployed Pasifika women living in Auckland - there was no difference in their likelihood of moving into employment when compared to NZ European women. But during Covid-19, there was a 5.5 percentage point drop in their likelihood of getting a job compared to NZ European women. The research also found found that pre-pandemic, Pasifika men earned on average 22.5 percent less than NZ European men when entering employment. The disparity increased by a further 2.4 percentage points during the pandemic. It also found that pre-Covid-19, when compared NZ European women, Pasifika women were on average 0.4 percentage points less likely to exit unemployment. But during Covid-19, the probability gap widened to 1 percentage point, meaning the pandemic deteriorated Pasifika women's chances of entering employment by 0.6 percentage points. Lead author of the report, Dr Alexander Plum from the NZWRI, said it was important to tackle the gaps. \"There must be as a first step awareness of what is going on. Being aware [that] there is this large gap between both populations and [have] the willingness to try to somehow address this gap. \"The other [reason] why it's so crucial is because it's affecting young people, it can leave a long term scar on their career and make progression in the future harder.\" It was important to improve access to education, training, building pathways to higher occupations or have active labour market programmes for displaced workers, Plum said. AUT professor and NZWRI director Gail Pacheco said while the labour market was generally robust during the pandemic, not everyone managed to benefit from it. \"Covid-19 has amplified the prevalence of ethnic disparities in the workforce, but it did not create those disparities in the first place. Therefore, policy needs to not only tackle recent Covid-related disruptions to the workforce but be long-term focused on addressing the entrenched disparities evident before the pandemic hit.\" The research was commissioned by the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment.\n",

incident. A Ministry of Health spokesperson said the person who visited the Hamilton District Court this morning has tested negative for Covid-19. \"The precautionary action to lockdown the court was taken by local agencies after some initial reports that the person had symptoms consistent with Covid-19. \"The Ministry of Health acknowledges our border workers willingness to undergo regular Covid-19 tests that are helping keep all New Zealanders safe from Covid-19. These people do not need to stay home - unless they develop symptoms.\" Up to 50 people are being treated as casual contacts and have been told they aren't required to do any mandatory quarantine. The court lockdown was issued about 10am and lifted at 11.30am. In a statement, a Ministry of Justice spokesperson said the court was shut as a precautionary measure and in line with Covid-19 protocols developed to deal with these situations. \"Court participants have now left the court after supplying contact tracing information,\" Maeve Neilson, acting deputy secretary corporate and digital services, said. \"The court building will remain closed for the rest of the day while areas are sanitised appropriately in line with Ministry of Health guidance.\" The ministry is urging people who feel unwell to not come to the courthouse, and for other attendees to use the NZ Covid Tracer app. If you have symptoms of the coronavirus, call the NZ Covid-19 Healthline on 0800 358 5453 (+64 9 358 5453 for international SIMs) or call your GP - don't show up at a medical centre\n",

                                               As Covid-19 spreads around the world, it can be daunting keeping up with the information. For RNZ, our responsibility is to give you verified, up to the minute, trustworthy information to help you make decisions about your lives and your health. We'll also be asking questions of officials and decision makers about how they're responding to the virus. Our aim is to keep you informed. The government gave New Zealand a glimpse of what life will look like under a Covid-19 alert level three. There will be a partial re-opening of education. Pre-school and schooling will be open for up to Year 10. Public playgrounds would remain off-limits under Covid-19 alert level three. Some businesses, including bars, cafes, restaurants, malls and retail stores will not be able to operate in their usual way, but deliveries, takeaways and online shopping can take place. Funerals and weddings will be allowed to go ahead with services only, but just 10 people will be able to attend. People will also be able to swim, surf and fish from the shore. Cabinet will make a decision on Monday about whether to move to level three or not. *See all RNZ Covid-19 news See how the day's Covid-19 developments unfolded with RNZ's love blog: Read more about the Covid-19 coronavirus: See all RNZ Covid-19 news Your Covid-19 questions answered - from health and employment to managing anxiety Covid-19 symptoms: What they are and how they make you feel Coronavirus: A glossary of terms The Coronavirus Podcast\n",
